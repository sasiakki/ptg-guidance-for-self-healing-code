Fix for the DT-620:
1. Code modifications were performed in the glue job "glue-qualtrics-os-completions-raw-to-raw-traininghistory" to switch the training source from "QUAL" to "YouTube" 
2. Updated the db_scripts/adhoc_dt_620.sql with the following scripts:  
update prod.transcript set  trainingsource =  'YouTube' , recordmodifieddate = localtimestamp where trainingsource = 'QUAL';

June 21,2023- Changed the naming convention from YouTube to YOUTUBE in the glue job and adhoc_dt_620.sql
update prod.transcript set  trainingsource =  'YOUTUBE' , recordmodifieddate = localtimestamp where trainingsource = 'QUAL';
